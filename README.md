# RickAndMortyAPI
practicing POO, printing data from an API and other stuff that i will imagine in the way.
Fetch API, async / await. This will be funny.

If you want to use the API you can visit the website in the link below.

To clone the project just press the green button "code" there you can download all the files or copy the link and add manually to your local repo.

Hope you like it! ;)
